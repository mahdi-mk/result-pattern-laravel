# Result Pattern in Laravel
The result pattern is designed to unify and encapsulate the return types of your business layer functions. Instead of relying on exceptions, it encourages handling errors gracefully by returning detailed messages to the client. This approach not only improves error handling but also makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain.

To demonstrate this pattern, imagine a function that can either succeed with a result or fail with an error. The result pattern allows you to create strongly-typed outcomes that capture both success and failure scenarios, enhancing readability and clarity in your code.
```php
class MyBusinessLogic
{
    public function execute(): Result
    {
        if (Some Exception) {
          return Result::failure(Error::make('Code', 'Message'));
        }
      
      	...
          
        return Result::success(Some Data);
    }
}
```
